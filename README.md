# iOS Technical Examination

This technical examination is to assess your skills in iOS development. You can implement any architecture you want, any libraries that will help you to finish faster. If there's an unclear part of the instruction or you have any questions, feel free to send us an email. Let's begin!

## Goal

The main goal you need to achieve is to display a list of user information. The UI design element will come from an API endpoint and you need to render the UI dynamically based on the JSON response of View Element Endpoint. And the data that you will be populated in the list will come from the endpoint given in the data attribute from list element. Look and feel is not an issue, a simple UI rendering will do.

**What you need?**
* **View Element Endpoint** - http://www.mocky.io/v2/5afaa7cd2e00005000279004
* **data** attribute where the endpoint of the user data is indicated

**Note**
* Any of the user field can be empty or null, once it happened, you should hide the TextView that displays it.
* Remember that I could interchange the position of each textview fields and the sequence must be followed.
* `data` attribute in the element `userInfoList` is dynamic, so anytime it can be change where the user data will come from.
* You can just display the list item on a linear layout.
* The `id` of each fields in the element `userInfoList` is associated with the fields of the user model. You can use this in order display the correct data for each fields.
